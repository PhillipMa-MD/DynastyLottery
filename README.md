## Simulator for Dynasty League Lottery System

This is a streamlit app I wrote to simulate different weighting schemes for a dynasty fantasy football league that I am the commissioner for. 

For the uninitiated, in dynasty football, each year you just do a rookie draft to draft newly drafted players in the NFL. We aimed to create a system that achieved the following:

1. More frequently than not, provide the worst performing teams with the best opportunity to draft the 'best' players
2. To reward the winner of the consolation bracket (consisting of teams that did not make the playoffs)
3. Adding some element of randomness for fun

So a user can change the weights and see how it affects simulated draft orders to see if the model produces ridiculous draft orders that nobody wants (the previous year's winner getting #1 overall)
